# Visa-Bulletin-Progress-Tracking

This project is to provide notification when new visa bulletin for the next month is added on the US immigration page. It includes 3 main features:
- Landing page is to register the priority date, country name, employment-based preferences, email address. For POC purposes, the site only targets employment based immigration. 
- The visa bulletin page (https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin.html) will get pulled when the new visa bulletin is being added and will update users who registered
- The notification provides information such as the new processing date, progress chart since the priority date
